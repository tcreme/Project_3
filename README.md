The goal of the game is to make it to the water. Using the arrow keys, direct the player towards the water, but be sure to avoid the enemies moving at different speeds across the canvas. If the player makes it to the water, a congratulatory pop-up window appears with an option to replay. If there is a collision between the player and an enemy, the number of lives the player has left decreases. There is a total of three lives. When no lives remain, a pop-up window for a game over appears with an option to replay.
